## Requirements

First create a virtual environment and activate it.  
Now , write the following two commands (required for recommendation system)

```
	
We used the following project for the recommendation system which uses collaborative filtering :  
https://github.com/ocelma/python-recsys  

Now clone the above repository  
```	
$ git clone https://github.com/ocelma/python-recsys.git
